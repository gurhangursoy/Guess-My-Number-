Try to guess the number from 1 to 20 hidden behind the question mark. Each wrong guess will reduce your score by 1 point. 
Don't forget to pay attention to the warning on the right while making your predictions. 
It will tell you that your guess is more or less, and will get you to your goal. 
Have fun :)
